# Community Wiki for Self-Driving Car Engineers

Useful resources for everyone attending the [Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) on [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) – from students, for students!

The Wiki is just starting up. You can find an [overview of all projects](PROJECTS.md), and some additional [tips & tricks](TIPS_AND_TRICKS.md).

## Vision

Collect useful resources to help students understand and master everything that they need to know about self-driving cars.

## How to participate

Simply edit/add a markdown file and we'll merge your PR! 😀
